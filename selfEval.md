# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? challenge 3 was intimidating, I panicked at first and then took a minute and realized it wasn't so  bad
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I think my notes are good, they are helpful but I also feel like they are really slowing me down
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I find Googling super unhelpful, it seems all other sites use slightly different language than we do here and I find it overwhelming and hurtful. I would like more direct examples from instructors. I find group collaboration, just hanging out in study hall can be very helpful.
